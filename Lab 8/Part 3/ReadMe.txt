Hello,

Please note that for Part 3 of the report, the same constraints file was used as I considered the password to use only 2 buttons however the ohter 2 buttons are some other active buttons that may interrupt the passcode, they are invalid inputs that act as other possible inputs to test the funcitonality of the lock!

Have a great day!
